A system for selling pharmaceutical products dedicated especially to the employees of Dr.Max S.R.L., as well as its collaborators, represents an initiative with significant potential to improve both the personal well-being of employees and organizational efficiency. This system can be seen as a tool for motivation and development for employees, with extended benefits on the company's performance.
